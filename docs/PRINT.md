# Print Settings (Voron Trident, 0.4 nozzle)

## Recommended
- Layer height: 0.20 mm
- Walls: 4
- Top/Bottom: 5
- Infill: 30% (gyroid or cubic)
- Material: PETG (fast proto) or ASA (better heat stability)
- Supports: only from build plate (minimal)

## Orientation
- Base plate: flat on bed
- Camera bar: flat on longest face
- Clamps: flat back on bed

## Notes
- Keep camera bar rigid; avoid low-infill flex.
- Use the same print profile for both clamps to reduce dimensional mismatch.
- Re-run camera alignment calibration after assembly.
